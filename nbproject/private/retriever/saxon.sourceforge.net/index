<p>This is the home page for the Open Source SAXON XSLT processor developed by Michael Kay
    of Saxonica Limited. It also provides information about commercial versions of the Saxon product
    available from Saxonica.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon">project page</a> for Saxon.</p>

<p>Documentation for the current release of Saxon is available online at <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/">http://www.saxonica.com/documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You are invited to contribute to the Saxon project Wiki pages at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/saxon/index.php">https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/saxon/index.php</a></p>

<p>The latest version of Saxon is <a href="#F9.4EE">version 9.4</a>, released on 9 December 2011. Version 9.3 remains available, and may be a safer
    option for the time being if you have no need for the new features offered by 9.4.</p>    
    
<p>Since Saxon 9.2, instead of the two versions of the product (Saxon-B and Saxon-SA)
that existed previously, there are now three editions:</p>

<ul>
    
    <li><p><b><a href="#F9.4HE">Saxon-HE</a> (home edition)</b> is an open source product available under the Mozilla Public License.
    It provides implementations of XSLT 2.0, XQuery 1.0, and XPath 2.0 at the basic level of conformance
defined by W3C. It is available for both Java and .NET.</p></li>

    <li><p><b><a href="#F9.4PE">Saxon-PE</a> (professional edition)</b> is a commercial product available at modest prices from
         <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxonica Limited</a>. It adds a number of features to Saxon-HE,
         including support for Saxon extensions and extensibility mechanisms, support for new features defined
         in XQuery 3.0 including higher-order functions, and easier configuration of features such as localization for different languages,
         and support for external object models such as JDOM, XOM, and DOM4J.</p></li>
         
    <li><p><b><a href="#F9.4EE">Saxon-EE</a> (enterprise edition)</b> is the fully-featured commercial product, essentially a renaming
        of the previous Saxon-SA to reflect the fact that it now offers much more than just schema-awareness.
        As well as a fully conformant XSD 1.0 and XSD 1.1 schema processor, and support for schema-aware XSLT and XQuery 
        processing, it offers many other features including streaming in XSLT and XQuery, support for XQuery
        updates, and advanced query optimizer, compilation of XQuery and XSLT code to Java bytecode, and much more.
    For full details, see the <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/">Saxonica</a> web site.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Saxon 9.4 on Java requires Java 5 (also known as JDK 1.5) or later. Saxon 9.1 was the last version to work with JDK 1.4.</p>

<p><i>Some features of Saxon 9.4 require Java 6.</i></p>

<p>Saxon 9.4 on .NET requires .NET framework 2.0 or later.</p>

<p>Saxon-HE does not offer all the capabilities that were present in Saxon-B. Most notably, support for Saxon
    extension functions and other extensions was dropped, as was the capability for writing extension functions
    that rely on dynamic loading of Java or .NET code (a new facility for "integrated extension functions" is
however available). Users whose code relies on these features of Saxon-B should either purchase the Professional Edition product
    or stick with Saxon-B: the latest release of Saxon-B is 9.1.0.8, and although there are no plans to develop
it further or maintain it, it will remain available indefinitely.</p>

    of the Saxon product is available</a>.</p>
        
<p>A <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/changes/intro.xml">detailed history of changes in successive releases</a>
is available.</p> 
    

<hr/>
 
 
<p>The Saxon XSLT 1.0 processor remains available. The latest version is <a href="#F6.5.5">version 6.5.5</a>.
    However, even if your stylesheets only require XSLT 1.0, it is probably better to run them under Saxon 9.x</p>

<p>From Saxon 9.4, the Subversion repository for source code is no longer maintained in SourceForge, but
    on the Saxonica site at <a href="http://www.saxonica.co.uk/repos/archive/opensource">http://www.saxonica.co.uk/repos/archive/opensource</a>.
    The repository does not contain the development branch of the code, only versions that have been released; it
    is the best way of obtaining bug fixes quickly if you are prepared to build the product from source (which is not for the faint-hearted).


<p>Note that bug fixes are typically made available in Subversion as soon as they are available, and are then consolidated
    periodically into a maintenance release. Source code under development is <b>not</b> held in Subversion, and is not available
    until a tested release is issued. Sometimes prereleases of new facility releases are made available for testing; these
are announced on the saxon-help mailing list but will not generally be advertised here.</p>

<p>Older releases of Saxon-HE remain available from SourceForge: see the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/">SourceForge download page</a> for details. If you require a release that
is no longer listed, please ask: we can't offer to support it, but in general we don't mind you using it at your own risk.</p>


<h2>Older Products</h2>

<h3>Saxon-B</h3>


<p>The last release of Saxon-B was version 9.1.0.8. This was a complete
and conformant implementation of the XSLT 2.0, XQuery 1.0, and XPath 2.0 
Recommendations published on 23 January 2007 by W3C.</p>

<p>Saxon 9.1.0.8 remains available
on both the Java and .NET platforms.
<!--It is the latest maintenance build of Saxon 9.0, which provides a large number of enhancements over
previous releases.-->
Changes since Saxon 9.0 are listed in the  
<a href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/changes/intro.html">change log</a>. For the bug fixes
in each successive maintenance release, see the Release Notes and Change Notes for the release
on the SourceForge downloads page. Known bugs, including details of their clearance, are listed in the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29872&atid=397617">Bugs tracker on the SourceForge project page</a>.</p>

<p>It can be downloaded from:</p>

</ul>



<h3><a name="F6.5.5">Saxon 6.5.5</a></h3>

<p>The last maintanence release of Saxon's implementation of XSLT 1.0. 
This product is mature and stable, and further developments are unlikely.</p>

<p>The download includes documentation, source
code, Java executables, and sample code.</p>

<p>Known limitations of this release are listed <a href="saxon6.5.5/limitations.html"/>here</a>. This page
will be updated with information about any new bugs that come to light.</p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="F6.5.3">Saxon 6.5.3</a></h3>

<p>The previous release of Saxon's implementation of XSLT 1.0. This product remains available because
it runs in some environments that are not supported by Saxon 6.5.5, notably under JDK 1.1.</p>

<p>The download includes documentation, source
code, Java executables, and sample code.</p>

<p>Known limitations of this release are listed <a href="saxon6.5.3/limitations.html"/>here</a>.
<i>No further updates will be made to this page.</i></p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="I6.5.3">Instant Saxon 6.5.3</a></h3>

<p>The most recent version of the Instant Saxon product. Instant Saxon was built using
the same source code as Saxon 6.5.3, but was packaged for ease of installation when using
the Microsoft Java VM. Since the Microsoft Java VM is no longer a standard component of the
Windows platform, this release has outlived its usefulness, but it remains available
for download by existing users.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Other products</h3>

<p>There is a custom Ant task for invoking Saxon XSLT transformations. This was previously issued as part
    of the Saxon product but has now been separated into a separate package under the Saxon SourceForge project.
    It is no longer actively developed and is not recommended (there are a number of bugs, and it is difficult
    to improve the quality because of an absence of test material). The download is
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=29872&package_id=282299">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="aelfred.html">&AElig;lfred XML Parser</a> that was bundled with Saxon versions
up to version 7.1 is now available as a separate download. It is of historic interest only.</p>

<p>Also available on this site is the <a href="dtdgen.html">DTDGenerator</a> program. This was formerly
produced as a Saxon demonstration application, but has since been adapted to work as a pure
SAX application, with no dependencies on the Saxon software.</p>

<p>Documentation for earlier releases remains present on the SourceForge web site:
<a href="saxon6.4.2">6.4.2</a>, 
<a href="saxon6.4.3">6.4.3</a>,
